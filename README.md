We live in the century of speed. Everything around us is moving fast. The development of the
means of transport has made our planet seem small, every person from every corner of the
world can travel anywhere in a few hours. But not all transport is represented by air. In 2018,
over 8 million vehicles were registered in Romania, with a population of almost 20 million,
that means 1 car for 2.5 people.
The application presented in this paper aims to help owners and vehicle users easily manage
their vehicles. Each vehicle needs variable periodic services (time limited, mileage limited),
but it also needs valid documents to enable it to travel legally (insurance, periodic technical
inspection, road tax).
Through a WEB portal, the user can update their vehicle documents, record their services,
update mileage, and add, modify and delete vehicles. Also, the user is notified by mail before
the expiration of a document / revision to prevent the unlawful circulation and expand the life
span of the vehicle.
